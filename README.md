### What I learned

One important concept I learned in this project was active states, especially for images. I learned how to use positioning to overlay images on top of each other. The following CSS was used to create an overlay for the image in the card when hovered on. 

```css
.image {
    position: relative;
}
.overlay {
    /* display: none; */
    background-color: #0ff1e8;
    opacity: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top:0;
    left:0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-around;
    transition: opacity .5s;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.image:hover .overlay {
    opacity: .5;
}
```
This corresponds to the following HTML5 code.
```html
    <div class="image">
      <img class="equil" src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="equilibrium">
      <div class="overlay">
        <img src="images/icon-view.svg" alt="hover effect">
      </div>
    </div>
```
These codes combine to create the following effect when hovering on the image:

### Continued development & learning

I'd like to learn more about positioning to help clarify some of the positioning issues I had run into along the way. I hope to use some of the knowledge I gained in this project to help me create hover cards in my own future projects.  

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Their articles on several CSS concepts such as Box Shadowing helped me with the styling used in this project. 
- Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts Course helped me get a strong understanding of flexbox and its various properties which I used.
- Web Dev Simplified's [youtube](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjz_ZK9-630AhUzO30KHUljDMkQwqsBegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Djx5jmI0UlXU&usg=AOvVaw05-mcMxRgXinlRZjFQv5-l) video on CSS positioning. This helped me use absolute positioning for the overlay image.
